For accurate calculation using

```text
min_method  bfgs
```

within that option

The more often you recompute it from scratch (via finite differences), the more reliably you will end up at the true minimum (as opposed to a saddle). Among the settings shown:

## **1. Finite-Difference Hessian at Every Step (Most Accurate)**

```text
min_hess_update  never 
min_init_hess  two-point
```

(BFGS method)

- `"never"` means the code does a **full finite-difference Hessian** at every optimization step (**most expensive, most accurate**).
- `"two-point"` is the **most accurate** finite-difference scheme for the **initial Hessian**.
- **If your system is not too large, this is typically the gold standard for rigorously converging to the correct minimum.**

---

```text
min_hess_update  never 
min_init_hess  one-point
```

(BFGS method)

- Similar logic, but with a **slightly cheaper one-sided difference** for the initial Hessian.
- Still **recalculates the Hessian at every step**, so it is very accurate, but **marginally less robust** than `"two-point"`.

---

## **2. Quasi-Newton Updates with a Good Initial Hessian (Balanced Approach)**

```text
min_hess_update  bfgs 
min_init_hess  fischer-almlof
```
(BFGS method)

- Here you **do not** re-compute the Hessian **fully** each iteration; you **rely on the BFGS update**.
- `"fischer-almlof"` is a **chemically motivated guess Hessian** that often performs **very well in practice**.
- **Best balance of speed and robustness if you cannot afford repeated finite differences.**

---

```text
min_hess_update  bfgs 
min_init_hess  diagonal
```

- Uses a **diagonal finite-difference Hessian** (off-diagonal elements set to zero) as the **starting guess**, then updates via **BFGS**.

---

## **3. Simplest Hessian Approximation (Least Accurate, Fastest)**

```text
min_hess_update  bfgs 
min_init_hess  identity
```


- Starts from the **simplest possible Hessian** (**identity matrix**).
- While it **can converge eventually**, it typically requires **more steps** to get an accurate curvature.

---

## **Final Recommendations**
For **absolute accuracy**â€”i.e., ensuring you truly locate the correct excited-state minimum:
1. **Option 1** (`never + two-point`) is the most **rigorous and accurate**.
2. **Option 2** (`never + one-point`) is **almost as good** but slightly less robust.
3. **Option 3** (`bfgs + fischer-almlof`) is a **great compromise** if computational cost is a concern.

If computational cost is too high for full finite differences, **option 3 (`bfgs + fischer-almlof`) is often the best balance of speed and robustness.**
